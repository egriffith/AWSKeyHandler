Simple python3 script to handle uploading, deleting, and listing of keys within AWS, making use of boto3.

## Arguments ##
keyhandler.py accepts a variety of arguments and flags depending on the action being taken. The only mandatory

Actions: 

"list" --> List the keys, their names and fingerprints, within the regions specified. --keyname can be specified to only look for a single key.

"delete" --> Delete a specific key from the regions specified. --keyname is mandatory.

"upload" --> Uploads a key to the regions specified. --keyfile will default to ~/.ssh/id_rsa unless otherwise specified, --keyname is mandatory for this command.

Additionally there are optional arguments for each command.

"--regions" / "-r" --> A comma delimited list of AWS region endpoints that the given action should be done against. Defaults to all regions if not specified.

"--profile" / "-p" --> The name of the profile to use from a user's ~/.aws/credential file for permissions. If your profile name includes a space, put this argument in quotes. Defaults to 'default' if not specified.

"--dryrun" --> Sets the DryRun flag on the API call. This is useful for testing IAM permissions without actually executing the call.
